# XFDraw
XFDraw is a realtime, high performance, software renderer written in C++ controlled via a wrapper written in C#. XFDraw is still in development, however with its WIP "Simple" mode XFDraw can handle insane amounts of polygons. It is the last and fastest version of the "renderX" series.

### Currently XFDraw is still WIP. Expect semi-regular updates.
